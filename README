Cisco IPCC / UCCX Full Screen Wallboard for Windows

There are several different wallboard applications for Cisco IPCC/UCCX, this one however has a number of unique features. Namely, instead of being an ASP web page, it's a stand alone Windows executable application that connects to a remote Contact Center server (or servers) via ODBC. It displays only one specific queue in a full screen mode. It's main purpose is to be run on an airport style display per each team. And it's free.

The wallboard comes in with a configuration file in where you can specify the queue name, odbc source, database credentials, colors, fonts, etc. Included are also installation instructions. Version 2.3 also includes over threshold blinking fields, beep sound alert and an option of arbitrary position on the screen to run several instances on the same LCD panel.

Versions 2.x are for UCCX 7.x ONLY!
